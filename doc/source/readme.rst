instack
=======

instack executes [diskimage-builder](https://github.com/openstack/diskimage-builder)
style elements on the current system.  This enables a
current running system to have an element applied in the same way that
diskimage-builder applies the element to an image build.

instack, in its current form, should be considered low level tooling. It is meant
to be used by higher level scripting that understands what elements and
hook scripts need execution. Using instack requires a rather in depth
knowledge of the elements within diskimage-builder and tripleo-image-elements.

An example of higher level tooling that uses instack to install a TripleO style
undercloud is at:
https://github.com/rdo-management/instack-undercloud

Usage
-----

Use the command line arguments for fine grained control over which elements to
apply, or drive instack via a declarative style json file (see
https://github.com/openstack/instack-undercloud/blob/master/json-files/centos-7-undercloud-packages.json
for an example).

Be aware that most elements are not idempotent. Subsequent runs of instack with the same set of elements
will often fail due to things files and directories already existing. One way around this is to write a clean up
element for your environment that cleans up before a run early in pre-install.d, and then always
include that element when you run instack.

<pre><code>
usage: instack [-h] [-e [ELEMENT [ELEMENT ...]]]
               [-p ELEMENT_PATH [ELEMENT_PATH ...]] [-k [HOOK [HOOK ...]]]
               [-b [BLACKLIST [BLACKLIST ...]]]
               [-x [EXCLUDE_ELEMENT [EXCLUDE_ELEMENT ...]]] [-j JSON_FILE]
               [-d] [-i] [--dry-run] [--no-cleanup]

Execute diskimage-builder elements on the current system.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -e [ELEMENT [ELEMENT ...]], --element [ELEMENT [ELEMENT ...]]
                        element(s) to execute
  -p ELEMENT_PATH [ELEMENT_PATH ...], --element-path ELEMENT_PATH [ELEMENT_PATH ...]
                        element path(s) to search for elements (ELEMENTS_PATH
                        environment variable will take precedence if defined)
  -k [HOOK [HOOK ...]], --hook [HOOK [HOOK ...]]
                        hook(s) to execute for each element
  -b [BLACKLIST [BLACKLIST ...]], --blacklist [BLACKLIST [BLACKLIST ...]]
                        script names, that if found, will be blacklisted and
                        not run
  -x [EXCLUDE_ELEMENT [EXCLUDE_ELEMENT ...]], --exclude-element [EXCLUDE_ELEMENT [EXCLUDE_ELEMENT ...]]
                        element names that will be excluded from running even
                        if they are listed as dependencies
  -j JSON_FILE, --json-file JSON_FILE
                        read runtime configuration from json file
  -d, --debug           Debugging output
  -i, --interactive     If set, prompt to continue running after a failed
                        script.
  --dry-run             Dry run only, don't actually modify system, prints out
                        what would have been run.
  --no-cleanup          Do not cleanup tmp directories
</code></pre>

Setup
-----

1. Make sure you have pip and git installed. If using your distro's pip, make you have at least pip version 1.5. There's a bug in older versions that causes some files to not be installed +x, which is a requirement for element hook scripts. To use upstream pip, see: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html

1. git clone this repository

        git clone https://github.com/rdo-management/instack

1. pip install the cloned instack

        pushd instack && sudo pip install -e . && popd

1. pip install diskimage-builder and tripleo-image-elements

        sudo pip install diskimage-builder tripleo-image-elements
If you so choose, you can use these from their git repositories instead:

        git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack/diskimage-builder
        git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack/tripleo-image-elements
        pushd diskimage-builder && sudo pip install . && popd
        pushd tripleo-image-elements && sudo pip install . && popd

Example Uses
------------

On Fedora, apply the keystone and mariadb element:

<pre><code>
sudo -E instack \
    -p /usr/share/tripleo-image-elements /usr/share/diskimage-builder/elements \
    -e fedora base keystone mariadb \
    -k extra-data pre-install install post-install \
    -b 15-remove-grub 10-cloud-init 05-fstab-rootfs-label
</code></pre>
